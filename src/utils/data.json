      "While those stats above may give you a general idea of my areas of interest, my actual list of interests is much less concise. Keeping up with technology both in terms of technical knowledge and culture has always been a mainstay of my life.",
      "And through the years, I've gained more interest in other fields the more I've learned about them. As a former architecture major, I've always been interested in the interrelationship between design and function. Through my college years, I've gained leadership experience in marketing roles and have come to be fascinated by the state of modern marketing and how closely it weaves with emergent technologies. Then I began to learn more about data analytics after some interesting classes and began experimenting with collecting and processing data on whatever I can, from measuring the performance/efficiency of my development projects to the marketing campaigns I ran for my student organizations.",
      "Development, design, marketing, data analytics: These all seem like some disparate disciplines, but I think if you look closely, they are all the same. If used morally, they are all modern methods that allow us to make sense of the world and contribute to it in a creative and meaningful way.",
